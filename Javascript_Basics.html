        <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>
            <span class="blue">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the cofee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purp">var x;</span> </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
            <span class="blue">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purp">var x = 10;</span></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
            <span class="blue">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span class=purp>true</span> or <span class="purp">false;</span> null - <span class="purp">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purp">42</span> or <span class="purp">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purp">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purp"> [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purp">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
            <span class="blue">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purp">if</span> a specified condition is ture, do this code in our code block; <span class="purp">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purp">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
          </li>
          <li></p>
            <span class="blue">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
            <span class="blue">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our funtion over and over and over again.</p>
